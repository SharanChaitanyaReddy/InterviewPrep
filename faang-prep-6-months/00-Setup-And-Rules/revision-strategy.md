# Revision strategy

A structured revision strategy ensures retention of concepts, speed, and confidence during interviews.

---

## 1. Daily Mini-Revision (5–10 minutes)
- Before starting each session, quickly review:
  - Yesterday’s code
  - Key patterns / algorithms learned
  - Notes and edge cases
- Purpose: Keep previous topics fresh in mind.

---

## 2. Weekly Consolidation
- At the end of each week:
  - Revisit all problems solved
  - Update weekly review markdown (`Revision/weekly-review.md`)
  - Annotate:
    - Problem patterns
    - Time & space complexity
    - Edge cases and optimizations
  - Mark checkboxes for **completed/understood** concepts
- Purpose: Identify weak areas early and prevent forgetting.

---

## 3. Monthly Review
- At the end of each month:
  - Consolidate weekly reviews
  - Update monthly summary markdown (`Revision/monthly-summary.md`)
  - Focus on:
    - Problem patterns and algorithm families
    - System design trade-offs
    - AI/ML pipelines and architectures
  - Update personal notes for mock interview preparation
- Purpose: Ensure cumulative retention and track overall progress.

---

## 4. Pre-Interview Blitz (1–2 Weeks Before)
- Focus only on weak spots marked in checklists
- Re-solve previously solved problems under **timed conditions**
- Quick review of:
  - Data structures & algorithms
  - System design diagrams
  - AI/ML pipeline flow
- Purpose: Build confidence and speed for interviews.

---

## 5. Checklist & Tracking
- Maintain **checkboxes** in markdown for every concept/problem:
```markdown
- [ ] Problem 1: Two Sum
- [x] Problem 2: Sliding Window Maximum
- [ ] Concept: LRU Cache Implementation
- [x] Concept: RAG Workflow
