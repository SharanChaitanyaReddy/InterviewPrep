# Week 16 – Month 4: Advanced Trees, Trie & Segment Trees

**Objective:**  
Learn advanced tree structures like Trie, Segment Tree, and Fenwick Tree. Understand use-cases in DSA for search, range queries, and optimization. Strengthen ability to choose correct data structure for a problem.

## Day 1: Advanced Trees – Overview & Recap

**Topics:**
- Review tree basics (Week 11–12)  
- Introduce advanced trees: Trie, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree  
- Real-world examples: autocomplete, range sum, dynamic intervals  

**Dependencies:** Trees: traversal & BST (Weeks 11–12), DP & recursion (Weeks 10–14)  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-16/day-01-advanced-trees-intro/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/trees/advanced-trees.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Implement binary tree structure templates  
- Annotate why advanced trees are needed

---

## Day 2: Trie Basics

**Topics:**
- Trie structure: insertion, search, deletion  
- Use-case: autocomplete, prefix search  
- Complexity analysis (time & space)  

**Dependencies:** Basic tree structure & recursion  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-16/day-02-trie-basics/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/trees/trie.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Implement Trie with insert & search  
- Annotate why Trie is better than hash map in prefix problems

---

## Day 3: Trie Problems

**Topics:**
- Solve prefix & word search problems  
- Example: word dictionary with wildcard, longest common prefix  
- Identify trade-offs: space vs speed  

**Dependencies:** Day 2 (Trie basics)  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-16/day-03-trie-problems/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/trees/trie-problems.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Solve 2–3 Trie-based problems  
- Document problem pattern → solution → complexity

---

## Day 4: Segment Tree Intro

**Topics:**
- Segment Tree concept, building & updating  
- Range query problems: sum, min, max  
- Time & space complexity  

**Dependencies:** Array knowledge (Weeks 5–6), Tree traversal (Weeks 11–12)  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-16/day-04-segment-tree-intro/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/trees/segment-tree.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Implement Segment Tree with build and update  
- Annotate why it is faster than naive range queries

---

## Day 5: Segment Tree Problems

**Topics:**
- Solve range query problems: sum, max, min, XOR  
- Advanced problems: lazy propagation  

**Dependencies:** Day 4 (Segment Tree Intro)  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-16/day-05-segment-tree-problems/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/trees/segment-tree-problems.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Solve 2–3 segment tree problems  
- Annotate recurrences, updates, and queries

---

## Day 6: Week Review & Postmortem

**Topics:**
- Consolidate Week 16 topics: Trie + Segment Tree + advanced tree concepts  
- Identify weak areas & create revision notes  
- Link code → weekly MD → documentation  

**Dependencies:** Days 1–5 topics  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-16/day-06-week-review-postmortem/`  
**Documentation Link:** `Revision/weekly-review.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Solve 1–2 review problems  
- Document edge cases, constraints, and key learnings

---

## Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- 90 minutes/day minimum  
- Concept → Pattern → Code → Optimization → Documentation  
- Revise previous weeks 5–10 minutes/day  
- Commit code + notes end of each day  
- Maintain links to weekly MD + documentation

---

## ✅ Outcome of Week 16

- Confident with Trie & Segment Tree  
- Able to solve range query & prefix problems efficiently  
- Timed coding practice improves accuracy and speed  
- Clear linkage of code → documentation → revision notes
