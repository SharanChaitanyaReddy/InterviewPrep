# Month 04 - Week 04 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Consolidate system design learnings and continue high-quality algorithm practice.

Focus Areas:
- Review previously drafted system designs and strengthen weak areas.
- Maintain algorithm momentum with mixed problem sets.

Weekly Goals:
- Revisit and improve 2-3 system designs and solve 6-8 algorithm problems.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Revisit an earlier design and iterate. 1-2 problems.
- Day 2: Algorithm practice (2 problems).
- Day 3: Design improvements and trade-off documentation. 1-2 problems.
- Day 4: Mixed practice and timed session. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Full mock interview (design + algorithm).
- Day 6: Consolidate and document changes.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- Design review checklists and architecture documentation templates.

Deliverables:
- Improved design documents and problem log.

Review & Retrospective:
- Summarize improvements and remaining gaps.

Notes:
- Emphasize communication and clarity when presenting designs.
