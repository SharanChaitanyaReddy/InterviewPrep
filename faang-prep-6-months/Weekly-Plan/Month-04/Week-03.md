# Month 04 - Week 03 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 15 – Month 4: Mixed Graph Problems & Advanced DP

Objective:

Solve mixed graph problems combining BFS/DFS, DP, and Greedy approaches

Apply graph DP in more complex real-world scenarios

Strengthen timed coding & optimization mindset

Day 1: Mixed Graph Problems – BFS + DFS + DP

Topics:

Problems that require a combination of BFS, DFS, and DP

Example: Number of distinct paths with constraints

Problem-solving pattern: identify dependencies → constraints → approach

Dependencies:

BFS/DFS (Weeks 13–14)

Graph DP (Week 14)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-15/day-01-mixed-graph-problems/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/mixed-graph-problems.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement counting paths in DAG with BFS + DP

Annotate why each approach is needed

Day 2: DAG – Longest Path Variants

Topics:

Longest path with weights

Longest path with multiple constraints

Real-world use: scheduling tasks with dependencies

Dependencies:

DAG knowledge (Week 14)

DP memoization/tabulation

Code Folder: Code/python/week-15/day-02-dag-longest-path-variants/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/graph-dp.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve weighted longest path problems

Annotate recurrences, optimization, edge cases

Day 3: Minimum/Maximum Cost Paths

Topics:

Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford (weighted graphs)

Applying graph DP for cost minimization

Tradeoffs: time vs memory

Dependencies:

Graph traversal (Weeks 13–14)

Priority queues / heap

Code Folder: Code/python/week-15/day-03-min-cost-max-path/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/min-max-path.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford

Solve 1–2 problems with path reconstruction

Day 4: Graph DP – Optimization Problems

Topics:

Applying DP on graphs for optimization problems

Example: Max profit with constrained paths, network reliability

Identifying subproblems → recurrence → memoization/tabulation

Dependencies:

Graph DP intro (Week 14)

Advanced DP (Weeks 10–12)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-15/day-04-graph-dp-optimization/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/graph-dp.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve graph optimization problems

Annotate why DP is required and tradeoffs

Day 5: Weekly Timed Session

Topics:

Solve 2–3 mixed graph problems in 90 minutes

Simulate real interview conditions

Focus on clarity, explanation, and efficiency

Dependencies:

Days 1–4 topics

Code Folder: Code/python/week-15/day-05-weekly-timed-session/
Documentation Link: Coding-Practice/timed-sessions.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement problems in one sitting

Record postmortem notes

Day 6: Week Review & Postmortem

Topics:

Consolidate Week 15 graph DP & mixed graph concepts

Identify weak areas & create revision notes

Link code → weekly MD → documentation

Dependencies:

Days 1–5 topics

Code Folder: Code/python/week-15/day-06-week-review-postmortem/
Documentation Link: Revision/weekly-review.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 1–2 review problems

Document edge cases, constraints, and key learnings

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes/day minimum

Concept → Pattern → Code → Optimization → Documentation

Revise previous weeks 5–10 minutes/day

Commit code + notes end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD + documentation

✅ Outcome of Week 15:

Able to solve mixed graph problems combining BFS, DFS, DP

Understand longest paths, min/max cost, graph optimization

Timed coding practice improves speed and confidence

Clear linkage of code → documentation → revision notes
