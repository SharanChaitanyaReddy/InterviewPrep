## Day 1: Mixed Graph Problems – BFS + DFS + DP

**Topics:**
- Problems that require BFS, DFS, and DP combined  
- Example: Number of distinct paths with constraints  
- Pattern: identify dependencies → constraints → approach  

**Dependencies:** BFS/DFS (Weeks 13–14), Graph DP (Week 14)  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-15/day-01-mixed-graph-problems/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/mixed-graph-problems.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Implement counting paths in DAG with BFS + DP  
- Annotate reasoning for chosen approach

---

## Day 2: DAG – Longest Path Variants

**Topics:**
- Longest path with weights  
- Longest path with multiple constraints  
- Real-world use: scheduling tasks with dependencies  

**Dependencies:** DAG knowledge (Week 14), DP memoization/tabulation  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-15/day-02-dag-longest-path-variants/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/graph-dp.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Solve weighted longest path problems  
- Annotate recurrences, optimization, edge cases

---

## Day 3: Minimum/Maximum Cost Paths

**Topics:**
- Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford (weighted graphs)  
- Applying graph DP for cost minimization  
- Tradeoffs: time vs memory  

**Dependencies:** Graph traversal (Weeks 13–14), Priority queues / heap  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-15/day-03-min-cost-max-path/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/min-max-path.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Implement Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford  
- Solve 1–2 problems with path reconstruction

---

## Day 4: Graph DP – Optimization Problems

**Topics:**
- Applying DP on graphs for optimization  
- Examples: Max profit with constrained paths, network reliability  
- Identify subproblems → recurrence → memoization/tabulation  

**Dependencies:** Graph DP intro (Week 14), Advanced DP (Weeks 10–12)  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-15/day-04-graph-dp-optimization/`  
**Documentation Link:** `04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/graph-dp.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Solve graph optimization problems  
- Annotate why DP is required & tradeoffs

---

## Day 5: Weekly Timed Session

**Topics:**
- Solve 2–3 mixed graph problems in 90 minutes  
- Simulate real interview conditions  
- Focus on clarity, explanation, and efficiency  

**Dependencies:** Days 1–4 topics  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-15/day-05-weekly-timed-session/`  
**Documentation Link:** `Coding-Practice/timed-sessions.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Implement problems in one sitting  
- Record postmortem notes

---

## Day 6: Week Review & Postmortem

**Topics:**
- Consolidate Week 15 graph DP & mixed graph concepts  
- Identify weak areas & create revision notes  
- Link code → weekly MD → documentation  

**Dependencies:** Days 1–5 topics  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-15/day-06-week-review-postmortem/`  
**Documentation Link:** `Revision/weekly-review.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Solve 1–2 review problems  
- Document edge cases, constraints, and key learnings

---

## Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- 90 minutes/day minimum  
- Concept → Pattern → Code → Optimization → Documentation  
- Revise previous weeks 5–10 minutes/day  
- Commit code + notes end of each day  
- Maintain links to weekly MD + documentation

---

## ✅ Outcome of Week 15

- Able to solve mixed graph problems combining BFS, DFS, DP  
- Understand longest paths, min/max cost, graph optimization  
- Timed coding practice improves speed and confidence  
- Clear linkage of code → documentation → revision notes
