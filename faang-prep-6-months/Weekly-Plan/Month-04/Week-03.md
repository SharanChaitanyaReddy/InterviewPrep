# Month 04 - Week 03 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Strengthen design-to-implementation reasoning and practice lower-level design decisions.

Focus Areas:
- API design, data modeling, and offline/real-time processing trade-offs.
- Continue algorithm practice focusing on implementation details.

Weekly Goals:
- Complete 1 design with data-modeling details and 6 algorithm problems.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: API and data-modeling practice. 1-2 problems.
- Day 2: Algorithm practice (2 problems).
- Day 3: Design: real-time vs batch processing decisions. 1 problem.
- Day 4: Mixed practice and code-quality focus. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Timed mock interview.
- Day 6: Consolidate notes.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- System design articles and API best practices.

Deliverables:
- Data model sketches and updated problem log.

Review & Retrospective:
- Note implementation trade-offs and document decisions.

Notes:
- Aim for clarity and maintainability when proposing designs.
