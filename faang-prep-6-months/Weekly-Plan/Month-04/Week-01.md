# Month 04 - Week 01 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Shift focus to system design depth and end-to-end architectural thinking while maintaining algorithm practice.

Focus Areas:
- System design deep dives: databases, caching, load balancing.
- Continue solving medium-hard algorithm problems.

Weekly Goals:
- Complete 1 medium-system design sketch and 6-8 algorithm problems.
- Prepare deeper STAR behavioral answers.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Read a system design topic and sketch components. 1 problem.
- Day 2: Algorithm practice (2 problems).
- Day 3: Design sketch iteration and trade-off analysis. 1-2 problems.
- Day 4: Mixed algorithm practice. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Timed mock interview including behavioral questions.
- Day 6: Review and refine design notes.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- System Design Primer, Designing Data-Intensive Applications.

Deliverables:
- Detailed design sketch and problem log.

Review & Retrospective:
- Note missing depth areas in design knowledge and schedule follow-ups.

Notes:
- Use diagrams for system sketches; practice explaining them in 5 minutes.
