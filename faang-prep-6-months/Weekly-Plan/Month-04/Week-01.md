# Month 04 - Week 01 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 13 – Month 4: Graphs & Advanced Trees – BFS/DFS & Traversals

Objective:

Deep dive into Graphs: BFS, DFS, shortest path, cycle detection

Advanced Tree traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder, level order)

Connect graph/tree concepts to problem patterns

Day 1: Graph Introduction

Topics:

Graph definitions: nodes, edges, weighted/unweighted, directed/undirected

Graph representations: adjacency matrix, adjacency list

Real-world applications (social networks, maps, task dependencies)

Complexity of graph storage & operations

Dependencies:

Arrays, linked lists (for adjacency list representation)

Recursion (for traversal prep)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-13/day-01-graph-intro/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/graphs/bfs-dfs.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement graph creation using adjacency list & matrix

Visualize small graphs for practice

Day 2: BFS & DFS

Topics:

BFS: queue-based traversal, level-order, shortest unweighted path

DFS: recursion & stack, backtracking style exploration

Compare BFS vs DFS: use cases & complexity

Dependencies:

Day 1 (graph representation)

Track visited nodes, path reconstruction

Day 3: Shortest Paths

Topics:

Dijkstra’s algorithm (weighted graphs, no negative cycles)

Bellman-Ford algorithm (negative weights)

Applications: navigation, task scheduling

Dependencies:

Day 2 (BFS/DFS)

Priority queues & heaps

Day 5: Tree Traversals

Topics:

Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level-order traversals

Recursive vs iterative implementation

Advanced concepts: height, diameter, LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)

Dependencies:

Core trees from Week 9–11

Stacks, recursion

Code Folder: Code/python/week-13/day-05-tree-traversals/

Identify weak areas & dependencies

Dependencies:

Days 1–5 (graph & tree concepts)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-13/day-06-week-review-postmortem/
Documentation Link: Revision/weekly-review.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 1–2 medium graph/tree problems

Maintain postmortem notes

Ensure all code links to weekly MD file

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes/day minimum

Concept → Pattern → Code → Optimization → Documentation

Revise previous weeks 5–10 minutes/day

Commit code + notes end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD + documentation

✅ Outcome of Week 13:

Solid understanding of graphs and advanced tree traversals

Hands-on coding & timed problem-solving

Clear linkage between code → weekly MD → revision notes

Ready to move on to Graph Advanced Topics & Problem Patterns in Week 14
