# Month 04 - Week 02 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Practice large-scale system design scenarios and complex algorithmic problems.

Focus Areas:
- Scalability patterns, data partitioning, and consistency models.
- Hard algorithm problems and multi-step reasoning.

Weekly Goals:
- Draft 2 large-scale system designs and solve 6-8 hard/medium problems.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Design: caching and partitioning strategies. 1-2 problems.
- Day 2: Algorithm practice (2 problems).
- Day 3: Design: consistency and replication. 1 problem.
- Day 4: Mixed algorithm practice. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Full mock interview (design + algorithm).
- Day 6: Review notes and refine designs.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- Real-world system postmortems and design articles.

Deliverables:
- Two system designs and a problem log.

Review & Retrospective:
- Capture trade-offs and missing knowledge areas for follow-up.

Notes:
- Practice sketching designs quickly and iterating based on feedback.
