Week 1 – Month 1: Foundations & Python Setup

Objective:
Start with Python environment setup, basic computing foundations, practical math, and problem-solving mindset. This week establishes the groundwork for DSA, Python coding, and optimization thinking.

Day 1: Python Setup & Tooling

Topics:

Install Python (Windows)

Configure VS Code with Python extensions

Git & GitHub setup

Create virtual environment

Project folder structure

Best practices (PEP8, virtual environments, documentation)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-01/day-01-setup/
Documentation Link: 00-Setup-And-Rules/tooling-setup.md

Outcome: Ready-to-code environment, GitHub repo initialized.

Day 2: How Computers Work

Topics:

CPU, Memory, Cache overview (impact on algorithm performance)

Stack vs Heap memory (recursion, allocation)

Why programs slow down (bottlenecks, cache misses, inefficient loops)

Dependencies: Hardware understanding → Optimization mindset → Problem-solving

Code Folder: Code/python/week-01/day-02-computers/
Documentation Link: 01-Foundations/01-how-computers-work/

Day 3: Practical Math – Counting & Growth

Topics:

Counting basics (addition, subtraction, combinations)

Multiplication & division (repetition, partitioning)

Big O intuition from counting & growth

Dependencies: Math → Complexity → Arrays/Loops in coding

Code Folder: Code/python/week-01/day-03-practical-math-counting/
Documentation Link: 01-Foundations/02-practical-math/counting-and-growth.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement simple loops counting elements

Calculate growth patterns with small arrays/lists

Day 4: Practical Math – Powers, Logarithms & Modular Arithmetic

Topics:

Powers & exponents (impact on loops, recursion depth)

Logarithms (binary search, halving strategies)

Modular arithmetic (hashing, cyclic problems)

Dependencies: Day 3 → Complexity understanding

Code Folder: Code/python/week-01/day-04-practical-math-powers-mod/
Documentation Link:

01-Foundations/02-practical-math/powers-logarithms.md

01-Foundations/02-practical-math/mod-arithmetic.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement power functions, modular sum examples

Compare iterative vs recursive solutions

Day 5: Problem Thinking & Optimization Mindset

Topics:

Brute-force thinking (start simple, correctness first)

Constraints-first approach (understand input, memory, time limits)

Optimization mindset (identify patterns, reduce complexity)

Dependencies: Days 2–4 → DSA fundamentals

Code Folder: Code/python/week-01/day-05-problem-thinking/
Documentation Link: 01-Foundations/03-problem-thinking/

Hands-on Coding:

Solve small brute-force examples in Python

Annotate code explaining why, when, and how each step is applied

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Minimum 90 minutes per day dedicated to learning/coding

Follow concept → pattern → coding → optimization order

Document code + learnings in GitHub

Revise previous concepts daily (5–10 minutes per day)

Commit and push code + notes at end of each day

✅ Outcome of Week 1:

Python environment ready

Foundational understanding of hardware and math for algorithms

Basic problem-solving mindset established

First Python coding exercises linked to weekly folder

GitHub repo workflow set up
