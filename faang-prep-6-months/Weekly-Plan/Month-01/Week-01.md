## Day 2: How Computers Work

**Topics:**
- CPU, Memory, Cache overview (impact on algorithm performance)
    **Dependencies:** Hardware understanding → Python basics   
    **Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-01/memory_play.py`  
    **Documentation Link:** `01-Foundations/cpu-memory-cache.md` 
- Operators & Expressions
    **Dependencies:** Hardware understanding → Python basics  
    **Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-01/operators-expressions.py`  
    **Documentation Link:** `01-Foundations/operators-Expressions.md/` 
- Input/Output and Type Conversion
- Stack vs Heap memory (recursion, allocation)
- Why programs slow down (bottlenecks, cache misses, inefficient loops)

 

**Outcome:**  
Understanding of basic computer architecture and memory management relevant for coding efficiency.

## Day 3: Practical Math – Counting & Growth

**Topics:**
- Counting basics (addition, subtraction, combinations)
- Multiplication & division (repetition, partitioning)
- Big O intuition from counting & growth

**Dependencies:** Math → Complexity → Arrays/Loops in coding  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-01/day-03-practical-math-counting/`  
**Documentation Link:** `01-Foundations/02-practical-math/counting-and-growth.md`  

**Outcome:**  
Ability to reason about algorithmic growth and loops.

## Day 4: Practical Math – Powers, Logarithms & Modular Arithmetic

**Topics:**
- Powers & exponents (impact on loops, recursion depth)
- Logarithms (binary search, halving strategies)
- Modular arithmetic (hashing, cyclic problems)

**Dependencies:** Day 3 → Complexity understanding  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-01/day-04-practical-math-powers-mod/`  
**Documentation Links:**  
- `01-Foundations/02-practical-math/powers-logarithms.md`  
- `01-Foundations/02-practical-math/mod-arithmetic.md`  

**Outcome:**  
Foundation for recursion, search algorithms, and hashing-based problem solving.

---

## Day 5: Problem Thinking & Optimization Mindset

**Topics:**
- Brute-force thinking (start simple, correctness first)
- Constraints-first approach (understand input, memory, time limits)
- Optimization mindset (identify patterns, reduce complexity)

**Dependencies:** Days 2–4 → DSA fundamentals  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-01/day-05-problem-thinking/`  
**Documentation Link:** `01-Foundations/03-problem-thinking/`  

**Outcome:**  
Ability to approach problems systematically and plan optimizations.

## Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Minimum 90 minutes per day dedicated to learning/coding
- Follow concept → pattern → coding → optimization order
- Document code + learnings in GitHub
- Revise previous concepts daily (5–10 minutes per day)
- Commit and push code + notes at end of each day

---

## ✅ Outcome of Week 1

- Python environment ready
- Foundational understanding of hardware and math for algorithms
- Basic problem-solving mindset established
- First Python coding exercises linked to weekly folder
- GitHub repo workflow set up
