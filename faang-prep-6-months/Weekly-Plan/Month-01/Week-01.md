# Month 01 - Week 01 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Build a solid foundation in core algorithms and problem-solving techniques. Establish a consistent daily practice habit.

Focus Areas:
- Fundamental data structures: arrays, strings, hash tables.
- Core algorithm patterns: two pointers, sliding window, sorting.
- Problem-solving skills: reading problems clearly, devising approaches, writing clean code.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 8-12 medium problems and 4-6 easy problems.
- Complete at least one timed mock interview.
- Make concise notes for every problem tackled.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Review fundamentals (arrays, strings). Solve 2-3 practice problems (easy → medium).
- Day 2: Two pointers & sliding window patterns. Solve 3 medium problems.
- Day 3: Hash tables and frequency counting. Solve 2-3 problems.
- Day 4: Mixed practice and pattern recognition. Solve 3 medium problems.
- Day 5: Timed session: 2 problems in 90 minutes, focus on communication.
- Day 6: Revisit mistakes and refactor solutions. Build summary notes.
- Day 7: Mock interview (45–60 min) + retrospective.

Resources:
- LeetCode Explore sections for arrays, strings, and hashing.
- "Elements of Programming Interviews" (selected chapters).
- Blind/Pramp for mock interviews.

Deliverables:
- Problem log with links, thought process, and final solutions for each problem solved.
- Recording/link to mock interview (if applicable).
- One-page summary of learnings and action items for next week.

Review & Retrospective:
- What went well: list successes.
- What to improve: identify recurring mistakes.
- Adjust next week’s focus areas accordingly.

Notes:
- Timebox practice sessions (e.g., 90 minutes focused + 15 minutes review).
- Use consistent naming and folder structure for solutions.
