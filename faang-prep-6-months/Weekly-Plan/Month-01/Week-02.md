# Month 01 - Week 02 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Continue strengthening problem-solving, focus on recursion and basic dynamic programming concepts.

Focus Areas:
- Recursion & backtracking basics.
- Introductory dynamic programming (memoization patterns).
- Practice writing clear recurrence relations.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 8-10 medium problems including recursion/backtracking.
- Complete 2 DP practice problems with memoization.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Recursion fundamentals, simple tree recursion examples. 2-3 problems.
- Day 2: Backtracking patterns (subsets, permutations). 2 problems.
- Day 3: Intro to DP: top-down memoization. 2 problems.
- Day 4: Mixed practice and pattern drills. 3 problems.
- Day 5: Timed problem-solving session (2 problems).
- Day 6: Review and consolidate notes, refactor solutions.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- LeetCode tags: recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming (intro problems).
- Grokking the Coding Interview (pattern-based explanations).

Deliverables:
- Problem list with solutions and notes.
- Short summary of DP patterns learned.

Review & Retrospective:
- Track progress against weekly goals; note weaknesses and plan remedies.

Notes:
- Focus on writing clear base cases and recurrence relations.
- When stuck, step back and write the brute-force recurrence first.
