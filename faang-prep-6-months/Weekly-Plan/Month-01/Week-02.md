# Month 01 - Week 02 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 2 – Month 1: Python Basics & Intro to Data Structures

Objective:
Deepen Python understanding, explore memory/performance implications, and start hands-on work with lists, dictionaries, and sets. Continue building the problem-solving mindset with small exercises.

Folder structure for code:

Day 1: Memory and Performance in Python

Topics:

References vs copies (mutable vs immutable objects)

Recursion depth and stack considerations

Time vs space trade-offs in small algorithms

Dependencies: Week 1 foundations → Python language basics

Code Folder: Code/python/week-02/day-01-memory-and-performance/
Documentation Link: 02-Python-Core/02-memory-and-performance/

Hands-on Coding:

Examples of shallow vs deep copy in lists and dictionaries

Recursive vs iterative functions, measure stack usage

Annotate why one approach is better for certain input sizes

Day 2: Lists and Common Operations

Topics:

List creation, indexing, slicing

Appending, inserting, removing elements

Iteration patterns, nested lists

Performance considerations (time complexity for operations)

Dependencies: Python basics + memory/performance

Code Folder: Code/python/week-02/day-02-lists-and-operations/
Documentation Link: 02-Python-Core/03-python-for-dsa/list-dict-set-usage.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement list-based problems (sum, reverse, find max/min)

Track time complexity for each operation

Add small test cases for validation

Day 3: Dictionaries and Common Operations

Topics:

Creating dictionaries, key-value pairs

Accessing, updating, deleting elements

Hashing concept (simple explanation for Python dict)

When to use dict vs list

Dependencies: Lists → Hashing basics

Code Folder: Code/python/week-02/day-03-dictionaries-and-operations/
Documentation Link: 02-Python-Core/03-python-for-dsa/list-dict-set-usage.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement frequency counter problems

Count occurrences in a list using dict

Track time complexity and explain why O(1) average for lookup

Day 4: Sets and Usage

Topics:

Set creation, adding/removing elements

Union, intersection, difference

Use cases in DSA (removing duplicates, fast membership check)

Dependencies: Dicts → Sets for optimization

Code Folder: Code/python/week-02/day-04-sets-and-usage/
Documentation Link: 02-Python-Core/03-python-for-dsa/list-dict-set-usage.md

Hands-on Coding:

Remove duplicates from lists using set

Solve small membership-check problems

Annotate why sets are efficient for specific operations

Day 5: Iteration Patterns

Topics:

For loops, while loops, enumerate, zip

Nested loops and performance impact

List comprehensions and generator expressions

When to use each iteration style (memory & speed trade-offs)

Dependencies: Lists, dicts, sets → iteration patterns

Code Folder: Code/python/week-02/day-05-iteration-patterns/
Documentation Link: 02-Python-Core/03-python-for-dsa/iteration-patterns.md

Hands-on Coding:

Loop over lists/dicts/sets for common problems

Convert loops into list comprehensions

Annotate why one approach may be better than another

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes per day dedicated to learning/coding

Follow concept → pattern → coding → optimization order

Document code + learnings in GitHub

Revise previous concepts daily (5–10 minutes per day)

Commit and push code + notes at end of each day

✅ Outcome of Week 2:

Python memory & performance understanding

Lists, dictionaries, sets mastered for DSA foundation

Iteration patterns understood with optimization thinking

All code linked to GitHub week-wise folder

Revision of Week 1 concepts reinforced
