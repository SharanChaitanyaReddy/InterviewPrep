# Month 01 - Week 03 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Emphasize trees and graphs fundamentals, traversal techniques, and typical interview questions.

Focus Areas:
- Tree traversals (DFS, BFS), binary tree problems.
- Basic graph representations and BFS/DFS on graphs.
- Shortest-path intuition for unweighted graphs.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 8-10 problems focused on trees and graphs.
- Implement BFS/DFS templates and reuse them across problems.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Binary tree traversal basics; solve 2 problems.
- Day 2: Tree problems (height, traversal variations). 2-3 problems.
- Day 3: Graph representations and BFS; solve 2 problems.
- Day 4: DFS-based graph problems and cycle detection. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Mixed timed session: 2 problems.
- Day 6: Consolidate templates and notes.
- Day 7: Mock interview + review.

Resources:
- LeetCode: tree and graph problem sets.
- CLRS sections for graph basics (optional for deeper understanding).

Deliverables:
- Implemented traversal templates with explanations.
- Problem log and weekly summary.

Review & Retrospective:
- Identify slow problem types and plan targeted drills.

Notes:
- Reuse traversal templates to save time during interviews.
- Practice explaining time/space complexity succinctly.
