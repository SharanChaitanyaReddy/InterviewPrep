# Month 01 - Week 03 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 3 – Month 1: Intro to DSA – Arrays, Strings & Problem Patterns

Objective:
Start building DSA foundation using Python. Understand arrays and strings thoroughly, learn basic operations, and apply simple problem-solving patterns. Keep memory, performance, and iteration considerations in mind.

Day 1: Arrays – Basics & Visualization

Topics:

What is an array (Python list as array analog)

Indexing, slicing, iteration

Understanding contiguous memory concept (why array operations have specific time complexities)

Dependencies: Python lists + iteration patterns

Code Folder: Code/python/week-03/day-01-arrays-basics/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/arrays.md

Hands-on Coding:

Create arrays, access elements, slice arrays

Small exercises: sum of array, find max/min

Annotate time complexity for each operation

Day 2: Arrays – Operations & Problem Solving

Topics:

Insertion, deletion, append

Traversal and iteration patterns

Array-based problem patterns: cumulative sum, finding duplicates, reversing arrays

Dependencies: Arrays basics → iteration patterns → memory consideration

Code Folder: Code/python/week-03/day-02-arrays-operations/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/arrays.md

Hands-on Coding:

Reverse an array in place

Find duplicates and unique elements

Annotate time & space complexity for each solution

Day 3: Strings – Basics & Representation

Topics:

String creation, indexing, slicing

Immutability and memory implications

Common operations: concatenation, repetition, search

Dependencies: Python strings basics → arrays for representation

Code Folder: Code/python/week-03/day-03-strings-basics/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/strings.md

Hands-on Coding:

Reverse a string, check palindrome

Substring search using loops

Discuss time complexity implications

Day 4: Strings – Operations & Problem Patterns

Topics:

Counting characters, frequency mapping

String comparison techniques

Pattern-based problems: anagrams, longest substring without repeating characters

Dependencies: Strings basics → hashing for frequency counts

Code Folder: Code/python/week-03/day-04-strings-operations/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/strings.md

Hands-on Coding:

Count characters in a string using dict

Solve simple anagram problems

Annotate time and space complexity for each approach

Day 5: Basic Problem Patterns

Topics:

Two-pointers pattern (array & string applications)

Sliding window introduction (simple substring problems)

Prefix sum introduction (basic sum queries)

Dependencies: Arrays + Strings + Iteration patterns

Code Folder: Code/python/week-03/day-05-basic-problem-patterns/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/03-problem-patterns/

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 2–3 problems per pattern (arrays and strings)

Annotate why pattern was used and complexity

Link solutions to GitHub for revision

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes per day dedicated to learning/coding

Follow concept → pattern → coding → optimization order

Document code + learnings in GitHub

Revise previous concepts daily (5–10 minutes per day)

Commit and push code + notes at end of each day

✅ Outcome of Week 3:

Arrays and strings fully understood, basic operations mastered

First exposure to DSA problem patterns (two-pointers, sliding window, prefix sum)

Code linked to GitHub week-wise folder

Reinforced Python iteration & memory understanding

If you approve, I can draft Week 4 which will move into hashing, stacks & queues, and deeper problem patterns, following the same day-wise, dependency-tree, code-linked format.

Do you want me to proceed with Week 4 next?
