# Month 01 - Week 04 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Focus on hashing, set operations, and string algorithms; strengthen pattern recognition.

Focus Areas:
- Advanced string problems (sliding window variants, substring searches).
- Hashing strategies for frequency counts and maps.
- Problem patterns combining strings and hashes.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 10-12 problems (mix of medium and a few hard string/hash problems).
- Create a cheatsheet of common string patterns.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Sliding window variations; solve 2 problems.
- Day 2: Advanced string algorithms (KMP overview optional). 2 problems.
- Day 3: Hashing patterns and map-based solutions. 3 problems.
- Day 4: Mixed practice with timed constraints. 3 problems.
- Day 5: Mock timed interview focusing on strings.
- Day 6: Consolidate notes and examples.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- LeetCode string problem set, GeeksforGeeks articles for specific algorithms.

Deliverables:
- Problem log, pattern cheatsheet, and mock interview feedback.

Review & Retrospective:
- Note recurring pitfalls (off-by-one, boundary conditions) and plan drills.

Notes:
- Maintain a list of template approaches for common string problems.
