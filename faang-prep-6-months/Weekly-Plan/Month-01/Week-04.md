# Week 4 – Month 1: Hashing, Stacks & Queues, and Intermediate Patterns

**Objective:**  
Build a solid foundation in hashing, stacks, and queues. Apply them to standard problems. Reinforce Python skills and link every concept to real-world application and problem-solving mindset.

## Day 1: Hashing – Basics & Understanding

**Topics:**
- What is hashing? Why is it used?
- Hash functions, collisions, chaining & open addressing
- Python dict and set as hash map implementations
- Real-world example: counting items, frequency maps

**Dependencies:** Arrays & Strings (Week 3) → Understanding iteration & frequency  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-04/day-01-hashing-basics/`  
**Documentation Link:** `03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/hashing.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Count frequency of elements in a list
- Find unique elements in a string
- Discuss complexity (average vs worst-case)

---

## Day 2: Hash Maps – Operations & Problem Solving

**Topics:**
- Insert, delete, lookup in Python dict
- Using dict/set for common problems: two-sum, duplicates, intersection
- Memory vs time trade-offs

**Dependencies:** Hashing basics → frequency counting → problem-solving patterns  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-04/day-02-hashmaps-operations/`  
**Documentation Link:** `03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/hashing.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Solve 2–3 small problems using hash maps
- Annotate why hash map was chosen, time-space analysis
- Link solution to weekly GitHub folder

---

## Day 3: Stacks – Basics & Operations

**Topics:**
- Stack definition and real-world analogy (function call stack)
- Python list and collections.deque as stack
- Push, pop, peek operations
- Applications: expression evaluation, balancing parentheses

**Dependencies:** Python lists → iteration patterns → stack concept  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-04/day-03-stacks-basics/`  
**Documentation Link:** `03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/stacks-queues.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Implement stack in Python
- Evaluate simple arithmetic expressions
- Check for balanced parentheses
- Annotate time-space complexity

---

## Day 4: Queues – Basics & Operations

**Topics:**
- Queue definition and real-world analogy (line at store)
- Python collections.deque as queue
- Enqueue, dequeue, peek
- Circular queue concept (brief)

**Dependencies:** Python lists/deque → stack understanding → iteration patterns  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-04/day-04-queues-basics/`  
**Documentation Link:** `03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/stacks-queues.md`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Implement queue in Python
- Solve simple problems: recent items tracker, moving average
- Annotate complexity & memory trade-offs

---

## Day 5: Intermediate Problem Patterns

**Topics:**
- Combined usage of arrays + hash maps + stacks/queues
- Pattern practice:
  - Next greater element (stack)
  - Sliding window max/min (queue)
  - Two-sum variants (hashing)
- Focus on concept → pattern → code → complexity analysis

**Dependencies:** Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Stacks/Queues  
**Code Folder:** `Code/python/week-04/day-05-intermediate-problem-patterns/`  
**Documentation Link:** `03-Complexity-And-DSA/03-problem-patterns/`  

**Hands-on Coding:**
- Solve 3–5 problems using combined patterns
- Annotate why pattern is chosen, time-space analysis
- Link all solutions to GitHub folder

---

## Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- 90 minutes per day for learning/coding
- Follow concept → pattern → coding → optimization → documentation
- Revise previous topics 5–10 minutes/day (arrays, strings)
- Commit code + notes at end of each day
- Maintain links to weekly MD file + documentation for easy navigation

---

## ✅ Outcome of Week 4

- Solid understanding of hashing, stacks, queues
- Ability to solve intermediate DSA problems using these structures
- Reinforced Python list/set/dict/deque usage
- Linked code to GitHub with annotated complexity analysis
- Dependencies maintained for Week 5 advanced topics
