# Month 03 - Week 10 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Day 1: Advanced DP Patterns

Topics:

Common DP patterns:

1D DP (arrays)

2D DP (grid problems)

DP with bitmasking

DP with multiple states

Mapping problems to patterns for faster recognition

Real-world example: inventory management, resource allocation

Dependencies:

Hands-on Coding:

Solve:

Grid unique paths

Minimum path sum

DP with multiple dimensions

Day 2: Space Optimization in DP

Topics:

Techniques to reduce space in DP problems:

Rolling arrays

In-place modification

State compression (bitmasking)

Trade-offs: readability vs efficiency

Practical use: large-scale problems where memory matters

Dependencies:

Day 1 advanced DP patterns

Arrays (Week 3)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-10/day-02-space-optimization/

Annotate memory usage comparison

Day 3: Mixed DP Problems

Topics:

Mixed problems combining:

Recursion + DP

DP + greedy insights

DP + graph traversal

Recognizing hybrid DP problems in interviews

Debugging DP solutions

Dependencies:

Weeks 7–9 (trees, graphs, DP basics)

Problem-solving strategies (Week 3)

Document recurrence relations, state choices, and optimizations

Day 4: DP on Graphs

Topics:

DP applications in graphs:

Shortest paths with constraints

DAG-based DP

Network flow basics

Mapping DP to real-world graphs (routing, scheduling)

Dependencies:

Week 8 (graphs)

Week 9–10 (DP fundamentals & patterns)

Annotate DP states on graph

Day 5: DP Review and Postmortem

Topics:

Consolidate all DP concepts learned

Post-mortem of mistakes from the week:

Misread constraints

State variable errors

Indexing/edge cases

Strategy for recurring revision

Link week’s code and documentation for review

Dependencies:

Days 1–4 (Advanced DP & optimization patterns)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-10/day-05-dp-review-and-postmortem/
Documentation Link: Revision/weekly-review.md

Hands-on Coding:

Re-solve 2–3 problems with optimizations applied

Create short notes for recurring DP patterns

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes per day dedicated to learning + coding

Follow concept → pattern → code → optimization → documentation

Revise previous weeks 5–10 minutes/day (trees, graphs, arrays, strings)

Commit code + notes at the end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD file + documentation for easy navigation

✅ Outcome of Week 10:

Mastery of advanced DP patterns and optimization techniques

Ability to solve medium-hard DP problems confidently

Full linkage of code → concept → weekly documentation

Structured DP notes for review and future reference
