# Month 03 - Week 02 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Strengthen medium-hard algorithm problem solving and introduce more design scenarios.

Focus Areas:
- Complex DP/graph hybrid problems, multi-step reasoning.
- System design: availability, partitioning, and consistency basics.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 8-10 medium-hard problems.
- Draft 2 design sketches focusing on trade-offs.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Complex DP practice. 2 problems.
- Day 2: Graph+DP or hybrid pattern problems. 2 problems.
- Day 3: System design trade-offs: read and sketch. 1-2 problems.
- Day 4: Mixed algorithm practice. 3 problems.
- Day 5: Timed mock interview.
- Day 6: Review and refine design sketches.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- LeetCode hard tagged problems, system design resources.

Deliverables:
- Problem log and two design sketches.

Review & Retrospective:
- Note complexity bottlenecks and communication gaps.

Notes:
- Practice explaining trade-offs succinctly during design sketches.
