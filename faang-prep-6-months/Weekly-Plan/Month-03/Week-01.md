# Month 03 - Week 01 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Ramp up focus on end-to-end interview skills including system design introductions and behavioral preparation.

Focus Areas:
- Basic system design concepts (scale, latency, caching) — high level.
- Continue algorithm practice with increasing difficulty.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 6-8 algorithm problems and complete one system design primer session.
- Prepare STAR stories for 3 behavioral questions.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: System design primer and reading. 1-2 algorithm problems.
- Day 2: Algorithm practice (medium-hard). 2 problems.
- Day 3: Behavioral prep: craft STAR responses. 1 problem.
- Day 4: Mixed practice and design sketching. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Timed mock interview (algorithms + behavioral).
- Day 6: Review and consolidate notes.
- Day 7: Design mock or peer review + retrospective.

Resources:
- System Design Primer (GitHub), Designing Data-Intensive Applications (chapters).
- Cracking the Coding Interview for behavioral tips.

Deliverables:
- One-page system design sketch, STAR story drafts, problem log.

Review & Retrospective:
- Identify gaps in system design intuition and behavioral answers.

Notes:
- Keep system design high-level; focus on trade-offs rather than full implementations.
