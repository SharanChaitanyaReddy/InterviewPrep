# Month 03 - Week 09 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 9 – Month 3: Dynamic Programming Basics

Objective:

Understand the fundamentals of Dynamic Programming (DP)

Learn memoization vs tabulation

Start solving classic DP problems step-by-step

Link DP thinking to real-world optimization problems

Day 1: Introduction to Dynamic Programming

Topics:

Concept: Overlapping subproblems & optimal substructure

Difference between recursion, memoization, and tabulation

Real-world examples: coin change, inventory management, route optimization

Recognize when DP is applicable

Dependencies:

Recursion (Week 6 trees)

Problem-solving patterns (Week 3–8)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-09/day-01-dp-introduction/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/dynamic-programming/dp-thinking.md

Hands-on Coding:

Convert simple recursive Fibonacci to DP using memoization

Track recursion tree and overlapping subproblems

Day 2: Memoization Patterns

Topics:

Top-down DP (memoization) approach

Choosing the right state variables

Storing computed values for reuse

Avoid recomputation, improve time complexity

Dependencies:

Day 1 DP introduction

Recursion depth (Week 2)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-09/day-02-memoization-patterns/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/dynamic-programming/memoization.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve:

Fibonacci / Tribonacci

Climbing stairs problem

Min-cost path problem

Annotate DP table states

Day 3: Tabulation Patterns

Topics:

Bottom-up DP (tabulation) approach

Iterative table filling

Space optimization techniques

Trade-offs: memory vs readability

Dependencies:

Memoization patterns (Day 2)

Arrays (Week 3)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-09/day-03-tabulation-patterns/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/dynamic-programming/tabulation.md

Hands-on Coding:

Convert memoized problems from Day 2 to tabulation

Practice 1D and 2D DP tables

Day 4: Classic DP Problems

Topics:

Knapsack 0/1 problem

Coin change (min coins and ways)

Longest increasing subsequence

Real-world mapping: budgeting, scheduling, inventory management

Dependencies:

Tabulation & memoization (Days 2–3)

Arrays/strings (Week 3)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-09/day-04-classic-dp-problems/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/dynamic-programming/classic-dp-problems.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve each problem step by step

Annotate states, recurrence relation, and optimization

Track time & space complexity

Day 5: DP Problem-Solving Strategy

Topics:

Step-by-step approach to identify DP problems:

Identify subproblems

Define state variables

Write recurrence relation

Choose top-down or bottom-up

Optimize space if possible

Common mistakes and debugging DP solutions

Dependencies:

Days 1–4 DP concepts

Problem-solving mindset (Week 3–8)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-09/day-05-dp-problem-solving-strategy/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/dynamic-programming/dp-thinking.md

Hands-on Coding:

Pick 2 mixed problems (from LeetCode / FAANG prep list)

Annotate step-by-step solution

Write post-mortem notes

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes per day dedicated to learning + coding

Follow concept → pattern → code → optimization → documentation

Revise previous topics 5–10 minutes/day (Weeks 7–8 graphs, Week 6 trees)

Commit code + notes at the end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD file + documentation for easy navigation

✅ Outcome of Week 9:

Strong foundation in DP (memoization & tabulation)

Able to solve classic DP problems

DP problem-solving strategy mastered for future weeks

Coding exercises linked with documentation & GitHub

I can now continue with Week 10 – Advanced DP & Optimization Patterns, keeping the same structured approach.

Do you want me to draft Week 10 next?
