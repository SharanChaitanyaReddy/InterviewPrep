# Month 03 - Week 12 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 12 – Month 3: Advanced DP, Greedy & Backtracking, Timed Practice

Objective:

Consolidate Dynamic Programming, Greedy, and Backtracking concepts

Practice timed problem-solving

Reinforce decision-making and optimization mindset

Day 1: Dynamic Programming Review

Topics:

Review DP fundamentals: memoization & tabulation

Key patterns: 1D DP, 2D DP, subset sum, LIS, knapsack

Identify overlaps with greedy problems

Annotate decision-making for problem selection

Dependencies:

Week 9–10 (DP introduction, memoization, tabulation)

Arrays, strings, and recursion

Code Folder: Code/python/week-12/day-01-dp-review/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/dynamic-programming/

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 2–3 previously solved DP problems, focus on optimization and clarity

Maintain notes for pattern recognition

Day 2: Greedy & Backtracking Review

Topics:

Quick recap of Greedy Algorithms

Quick recap of Backtracking

Compare: when to use Greedy vs DP vs Backtracking

Focus on pruning & optimal substructure

Dependencies:

Week 11 (Greedy & Backtracking concepts)

Recursion & arrays

Code Folder: Code/python/week-12/day-02-greedy-backtracking-review/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/greedy-and-backtracking.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 1–2 problems from each category (greedy + backtracking)

Annotate why a greedy approach fails if DP is required

Day 3: Combined Problems

Topics:

Mixed problem-solving: problems that involve DP + Greedy + Backtracking

Analyze constraints → possible approaches → optimal approach

Focus on decision tree annotation

Dependencies:

Days 1–2 (review of DP, greedy, backtracking)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-12/day-03-combined-problems/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/03-problem-patterns.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 2–3 mixed problems under no-timer mode

Document why each approach was chosen

Day 4: Timed Mock Session 1

Topics:

Simulate real FAANG coding interview

Solve 2–3 problems in 90 minutes

Practice clarifying questions, edge-case testing, explanation

Dependencies:

Day 3 (combined problems)

Previous weeks (all concepts learned so far)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-12/day-04-timed-session-1/
Documentation Link: Coding-Practice/timed-sessions.md

Hands-on Coding:

Record start/end time, mistakes, and optimizations

Annotate what could have been done better

Day 5: Timed Mock Session 2

Topics:

Another timed practice session, slightly harder problems

Reinforce confidence and speed

Review decision-making patterns under pressure

Dependencies:

Day 4 (timed session 1)

All previous concepts

Code Folder: Code/python/week-12/day-05-timed-session-2/
Documentation Link: Coding-Practice/timed-sessions.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 2–3 problems, record postmortem notes

Maintain linkage between code and weekly MD file

Day 6: Week Review & Postmortem

Topics:

Consolidate DP, Greedy, Backtracking patterns

Analyze mistakes from the timed sessions

Highlight key patterns and dependencies

Link all code + documentation for review

Dependencies:

Days 1–5 (review + timed practice)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-12/day-06-week-review-postmortem/
Documentation Link: Revision/weekly-review.md

Hands-on Coding:

Re-solve 1–2 challenging problems from the week

Maintain short notes + GitHub references for future review

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes per day dedicated to learning + coding

Follow concept → pattern → code → optimization → documentation

Revise previous weeks 5–10 minutes/day

Commit code + notes at the end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD file + documentation for easy navigation

✅ Outcome of Week 12:

Reinforced Advanced DP, Greedy & Backtracking skills

Timed practice to simulate interview pressure

Structured code + documentation + weekly notes

Clear linkage of code → concept → weekly documentation → revision
