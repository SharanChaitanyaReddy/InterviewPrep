# Month 03 - Week 11 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes per day dedicated to learning + coding

Follow concept → pattern → code → optimization → documentation

Revise previous weeks 5–10 minutes/day (arrays, strings, DP, graphs)

Commit code + notes at the end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD file + documentation for easy navigation

✅ Outcome of Week 11:

Mastery of greedy patterns and backtracking problems

Ability to choose correct approach for each problem

Structured code + documentation + weekly notes for review

Clear linkage of code → concept → weekly documentation → revision
