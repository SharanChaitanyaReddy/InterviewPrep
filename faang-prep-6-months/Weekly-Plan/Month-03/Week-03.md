# Month 03 - Week 03 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Focus on performance optimization, code quality, and debugging under interview constraints.

Focus Areas:
- Optimizing algorithms for time/space and writing clean code.
- Debugging strategies and edge case handling.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 8 problems with emphasis on optimizing solutions.
- Run through 2 debugging/correctness drills (finding and fixing bugs).

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Identify optimization opportunities in solved problems. 2 problems.
- Day 2: Refactoring for clarity and performance. 2 problems.
- Day 3: Debugging practice: seeded buggy solutions. 2 drills.
- Day 4: Mixed practice with optimization focus. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Timed mock interview.
- Day 6: Consolidate best practices and notes.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- Articles/posts on optimization patterns, debugging exercises.

Deliverables:
- Before/after solutions demonstrating optimizations and a debugging checklist.

Review & Retrospective:
- Track where optimizations provide most benefit; plan future practice.

Notes:
- Keep complexity analysis brief and precise during interviews.
