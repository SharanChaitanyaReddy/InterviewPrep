## **Week-wise Execution Plan**
All weeks follow **day-wise concept → code → documentation → revision** structure.  

- **Folder structure:** `WeeklyPlan/Month-X/Week-Y/`
- **Code:** `Code/python/week-Y/`
- **Documentation links:** `Revision/weekly-review.md`, `Revision/weak-spots.md`

### **Example: Month 1 – Week 1**
- **Day 1:** Python installation & setup (Windows, IDE, VSCode, pip, Git, virtualenv)  
- **Day 2:** Data Types + Mutability in Python  
- **Day 3:** Control Flow (if/else, loops)  
- **Day 4:** Functions & Parameters  
- **Day 5:** Practical Math: Counting, Multiplication, Division  
- **Day 6:** Brute Force & Constraints-first thinking  
- **Day 7:** Weekly Revision, commit code, update weak spots  

### **Month 1 – Week 2 → Month 6 – Week 24**
- Each week follows **similar day-wise structure**, progressively building:  
  - **Python Core → DSA → Advanced DSA → System Design → AI Foundations → Behavioral Practice**  
  - Each day includes **concept + hands-on code + documentation linking + postmortems**  
- **Week 24:** Final integration, full mock interviews, revision of all weak spots

---

## **Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)**
- Minimum **90 minutes/day**
- Sequence: Concept → Diagram/Notes → Code → Documentation → Postmortem  
- Commit **code + documentation daily**
- Maintain **links between weekly MD files, code folders, and revision notes**
- Use **reminders/alerts** to stay on track

---

✅ **Outcome after 6 Months:**  
- Complete **Python, DSA, Advanced DSA, System Design, AI foundations**  
- Daily **hands-on coding** with revision and postmortems  
- Behavioral prep ready with STAR stories  
- End-to-end **mock interview experience**  
- Comprehensive **GitHub repo with code, notes, and revision links**  

---




**Weekly Template **

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

---

## 2. Concept Learning (Immutable Reference)
> Read the concept docs first before coding. Include why/how/when for each topic.

**Reference Links:**
- Foundations / Python / DSA / AI concepts: `../01-Foundations/`, `../02-Python-Core/`, `../03-Complexity-And-DSA/`, etc.

**This Week’s Topics:**
- Concept 1: [Link to md file]
- Concept 2: [Link to md file]
- Concept 3: [Link to md file]
*(Adjust based on weekly roadmap)*

**Notes to take:**
- Write key points in your **weekly notes file**.
- Include **dependencies**: which topics rely on others.
- Real-world attachment: why this concept matters outside coding.

---

## 3. Hands-On Coding (Code Folder)
> All code for this week goes here: `Code/python/<category>/`

**Tasks:**
- Code 1: `<filename.py>` – Purpose, what you’re simulating, expected outcome
- Code 2: `<filename.py>` – Purpose
- Code 3: `<filename.py>` – Purpose

**Rules:**
- Every concept must produce **at least one code example**.
- Test code with edge cases wherever possible.
- Comment your code to explain **why/how/when**.

---

## 4. Problem Solving / Coding Practice
**Reference:** `Coding-Practice/weekly-problem-plan.md`

**Tasks for the week:**
- Arrays / Strings / Hashing / Stacks-Queues / Linked Lists / Trees / Graphs / DP / Greedy / Backtracking  
*(Include weekly quota: e.g., 10–15 problems per topic)*

**Timed Practice:**
- `Coding-Practice/timed-sessions.md`  
- Simulate **90-minutes, 2–3 problems**  
- Post-mortem after each session: log mistakes and root causes in `Coding-Practice/post-mortems.md`

---

## 5. Revision
**Daily:** `Revision/daily-recall.md` – Review **previous day’s concepts & code** (5–10 mins)

**Weekly:** `Revision/weekly-review.md`  
- Check weak spots  
- Add notes for missed concepts  
- Update progress tracker

**Monthly:** `Revision/monthly-summary.md`  
- Track overall progress  
- Adjust quotas / difficulty if needed

---

## 6. Behavioral Prep (Optional, 1–2 sessions/week)
**Reference:** `Behavioral/story-bank.md` / `Behavioral/weekly-practice.md`

**Tasks:**
- Pick 1–2 STAR stories  
- Practice answering “Tell me about a time…” out loud  
- Record yourself or do with a partner

---

## 7. Daily Execution Rules
- **90 minutes per day**, uninterrupted
- Concept → Code → Problems → Mini revision
- Follow your **ritual** before starting (coffee, notebook, timer)
- Track completion in a **progress tracker** file

---

## 8. Progress Tracker (Optional section)
- ✅ Concepts learned
- ✅ Code examples completed
- ✅ Problems solved
- ✅ Revision done
- ✅ Behavioral prep

---

## Notes / Reflection (Optional)
- Any concept still unclear
- Edge cases missed
- Ideas for improvement
- Motivational note for next day
