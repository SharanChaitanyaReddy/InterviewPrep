# Month 06 - Week 24 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 24 – Month 6: Consolidation, Mock Interviews & Final Review

Objective:

Consolidate all DSA, Python, System Design, and AI concepts

Practice mock interviews (coding, system design, behavioral)

Ensure all code + documentation + revision links are complete and connected
