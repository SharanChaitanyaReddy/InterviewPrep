# Month 05 - Week 18 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Commit code + notes end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD + documentation

✅ Outcome of Week 18:

Strong grasp of advanced DP patterns

Able to recognize memoization vs tabulation

Solve medium-to-hard problems efficiently

Clear linkage of code → documentation → revision notes
