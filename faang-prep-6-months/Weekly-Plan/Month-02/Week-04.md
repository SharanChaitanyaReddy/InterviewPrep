# Month 02 - Week 04 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Focus on advanced data structures and combined pattern problems.

Focus Areas:
- Segment trees / Fenwick trees (overview), sliding window + heap combos.
- Combine multiple techniques into single solutions.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 6-8 advanced problems that combine data structures and algorithms.
- Implement one advanced data structure (overview or simple implementation).

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Segment tree / Fenwick overview; simple problem.
- Day 2: Problems combining heap + sliding window. 2 problems.
- Day 3: Mixed advanced practice. 2 problems.
- Day 4: Timed problem-solving session. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Review implementations and notes.
- Day 6: Consolidate and clean code.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- LeetCode hard problems, research articles for specific data structures.

Deliverables:
- Advanced DS summary and problem log.

Review & Retrospective:
- Note trade-offs and when to apply advanced DS vs simpler approaches.

Notes:
- Implementation depth can be lighter when interview-time constraints exist; focus on concept clarity.
