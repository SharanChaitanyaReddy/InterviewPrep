# Month 02 - Week 03 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Practice harder graph problems and introduce shortest-path algorithms.

Focus Areas:
- Dijkstra, BFS variations, topological sort basics, and connected components.
- Weighted vs unweighted graph problems.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 8-10 graph problems including at least one shortest-path variant.
- Implement template solutions for Dijkstra and topological sort.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Dijkstra and priority-queue based shortest path intro. 2 problems.
- Day 2: Topological sort and DAG-based DP. 2 problems.
- Day 3: Union-Find and connected components. 2 problems.
- Day 4: Mixed graph problem practice. 3 problems.
- Day 5: Timed session focusing on graphs.
- Day 6: Consolidate templates and notes.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- LeetCode graph problems, CLRS for algorithm references.

Deliverables:
- Graph algorithm templates and problem log.

Review & Retrospective:
- Identify patterns that need more practice and plan follow-up.

Notes:
- Pay attention to edge cases with weights and disconnected graphs.
