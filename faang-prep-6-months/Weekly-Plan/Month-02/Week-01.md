# Month 02 - Week 05 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 5 – Month 2: Linked Lists & Recursion Introduction

Objective:
Build a solid foundation in linked lists and recursion, and understand how to apply them to problem-solving patterns. Reinforce Python concepts with hands-on coding and document everything.

Day 1: Linked Lists – Introduction

Topics:

What is a linked list? Singly vs Doubly vs Circular

Real-world analogy: train of nodes, connections

When to use linked lists vs arrays

Node structure and pointers in Python

Dependencies: Arrays (Week 3) → understanding linear data representation

Code Folder: Code/python/week-05/day-01-linked-lists-intro/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/linked-lists.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement basic Node class

Create a simple singly linked list with insert & display

Day 2: Linked Lists – Operations

Topics:

Insertion (head, tail, middle)

Deletion (head, tail, middle)

Searching nodes and traversals

Time and space complexity of operations

Dependencies: Day 1 linked list basics → node manipulation

Code Folder: Code/python/week-05/day-02-linked-lists-operations/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/02-core-data-structures/linked-lists.md

Hands-on Coding:

Insert/delete nodes at different positions

Reverse a linked list iteratively

Day 3: Linked Lists – Problem Solving

Topics:

Common patterns:

Detect cycle in linked list

Merge two sorted linked lists

Find nth node from end

Use of fast & slow pointers

Dependencies: Day 1–2 linked lists operations → pointers concept

Code Folder: Code/python/week-05/day-03-linked-lists-problems/
Documentation Link: 03-Complexity-And-DSA/03-problem-patterns/binary-search.md (link for pointer-related patterns)

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 3–5 linked list problems

Annotate pattern, time/space analysis

Day 4: Recursion – Introduction

Topics:

What is recursion? Function calling itself

Base case vs recursive case

Real-world analogy: Russian dolls, factorial, Fibonacci

Python recursion depth & stack behavior

Dependencies: Functions in Python (Week 2) → call stack understanding

Code Folder: Code/python/week-05/day-04-recursion-intro/
Documentation Link: 02-Python-Core/02-memory-and-performance/recursion-depth.md

Hands-on Coding:

Factorial using recursion

Fibonacci sequence using recursion

Trace function calls to understand stack

Day 5: Recursion – Patterns & Problem Solving

Topics:

Common recursion patterns:

Divide & Conquer

Backtracking foundation

Problems: sum of array, max element, reverse string

Linking recursion to tree traversal (preparation for Week 6)

Dependencies: Day 4 recursion intro → arrays/strings (Week 3)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-05/day-05-recursion-patterns/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/trees/recursion-model.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 3–5 recursive problems

Annotate base case, recursion depth, time/space complexity

Prepare notes for linked recursion → tree traversal

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes per day dedicated to learning + coding

Follow concept → pattern → code → optimization → documentation

Revise previous topics 5–10 minutes/day (hashing, stacks, queues)

Commit code + notes at the end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD file + documentation for easy navigation

✅ Outcome of Week 5:

Solid understanding of linked lists and operations

Introduction to recursion with base problems

Linked coding exercises with GitHub folder

Dependencies maintained for Week 6 (Trees)
