# Month 02 - Week 01 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Transition to medium-to-hard problems; reinforce prior topics and begin complexity optimization.

Focus Areas:
- Time/space complexity optimization techniques.
- Advanced use of data structures: heaps, balanced trees, tries.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 8-12 medium-to-hard problems focusing on optimization.
- Implement 1–2 non-trivial data structures (heap usage, trie insert/search).

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Review heaps and priority queues; 2 problems.
- Day 2: Tries and prefix problems; 2 problems.
- Day 3: Balanced-tree concepts and map set tricks; 2 problems.
- Day 4: Optimization patterns and code refactors; 3 problems.
- Day 5: Timed session: 2 problems.
- Day 6: Review and notes consolidation.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- LeetCode advanced topics, HackerRank for data structure practice.

Deliverables:
- Implemented data structure snippets and problem log.

Review & Retrospective:
- Identify optimization opportunities and recurring slowdowns.

Notes:
- Focus on readable, optimized solutions and justify complexity trade-offs.
