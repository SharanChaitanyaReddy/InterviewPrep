# Month 02 - Week 02 Plan – FAANG Prep

Overview:
- Primary objective: Deepen knowledge of dynamic programming and iterative DP patterns.

Focus Areas:
- Common DP patterns: knapsack, subsequence, interval DP (intro).
- Transition from recursion+memo to bottom-up tabulation.

Weekly Goals:
- Solve 8-10 DP problems across different patterns.
- Build a small DP patterns reference sheet.

Daily Plan:
- Day 1: Knapsack/subset-sum style problems. 2 problems.
- Day 2: Longest increasing subsequence/sequence DP. 2 problems.
- Day 3: Interval/partition DP (intro). 2 problems.
- Day 4: Bottom-up tabulation conversions. 2 problems.
- Day 5: Timed session and review.
- Day 6: Consolidate DP notes and patterns.
- Day 7: Mock interview + retrospective.

Resources:
- LeetCode DP tagged problems, online tutorials for pattern recognition.

Deliverables:
- DP pattern cheatsheet and problem solutions.

Review & Retrospective:
- Track which DP transformations were hardest; plan targeted practice.

Notes:
- Practice converting top-down to bottom-up to improve efficiency.
