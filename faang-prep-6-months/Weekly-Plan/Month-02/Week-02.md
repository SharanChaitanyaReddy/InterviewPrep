# Month 02 - Week 06 Plan – FAANG Prep

## 1. Motivation & Focus Reminder
- This 90-minute daily preparation is **non-negotiable**.
- Remember why you are doing this: building skills for **FAANG / top MNC**, mastering **DSA**, **system design**, and **AI fundamentals**.
- Focus on **small wins every day**, not the entire roadmap at once.
- Keep distractions away: phone on silent, no YouTube rabbit holes.

Week 6 – Month 2: Trees – Basics & Traversals

Objective:
Understand tree data structures, node relationships, traversals, and recursive patterns. Connect recursion knowledge from Week 5 to tree structures.

Day 1: Tree – Introduction

Topics:

What is a tree? Nodes, edges, root, leaves

Tree types: General tree, Binary tree, Binary search tree

Real-world analogy: File system, organization chart

When to use trees vs arrays/linked lists

Dependencies: Linked lists (Week 5), recursion basics (Week 5)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-06/day-01-tree-intro/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/trees/traversal.md

Hands-on Coding:

Create tree node class in Python

Build a small sample tree manually

Print tree in basic format

Day 2: Binary Tree – Construction & Properties

Topics:

Binary tree definition and properties (height, depth, size)

Insertion & traversal preparation

Python representation: Node classes, left/right pointers

Time/space complexity analysis

Dependencies: Day 1 tree intro, Python classes (Week 2)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-06/day-02-binary-tree-construction/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/trees/traversal.md

Hands-on Coding:

Build binary tree from array input

Implement helper functions: size, height, leaf count

Annotate recursive calls for height calculation

Day 3: Tree Traversals – DFS & BFS

Topics:

Depth-first traversal: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder

Breadth-first traversal: Level-order traversal

Recursion vs iterative approaches

Use-cases for each traversal

Dependencies: Day 2 binary tree construction, recursion patterns (Week 5)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-06/day-03-tree-traversals/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/trees/traversal.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement recursive DFS traversals

Implement BFS using queue

Compare recursive vs iterative approaches

Day 4: Tree Problem Solving Using Recursion

Topics:

Tree recursion patterns:

Root-to-leaf path sum

Max depth / min depth

Node count / leaf count

Connecting recursion patterns to trees

Dependencies: Recursion (Week 5), traversal (Day 3)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-06/day-04-tree-problems-recursion/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/trees/recursion-model.md

Hands-on Coding:

Solve 3–5 recursive tree problems

Annotate base case, recursion depth, time/space complexity

Prepare notes linking to upcoming BST and tree patterns

Day 5: Binary Search Tree (BST) – Intro & Operations

Topics:

BST properties and use-cases

Insertion, deletion, search

Time complexity: Best, Worst, Average

Real-world analogy: Ordered dictionary / lookup

Dependencies: Binary tree (Days 1–2), recursion (Week 5)

Code Folder: Code/python/week-06/day-05-binary-search-tree-intro/
Documentation Link: 04-Advanced-DSA/trees/bst.md

Hands-on Coding:

Implement BST insert, search, delete

Test BST with sample inputs

Annotate time/space tradeoffs

Daily Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

90 minutes per day dedicated to learning + coding

Follow concept → pattern → code → optimization → documentation

Revise previous topics 5–10 minutes/day (linked lists, recursion)

Commit code + notes at the end of each day

Maintain links to weekly MD file + documentation for easy navigation

✅ Outcome of Week 6:

Solid understanding of trees and BST fundamentals

Recursion fully applied to tree problems

Linked coding exercises with GitHub folder

Dependencies maintained for Week 7 (Graphs Introduction)
