# InterviewPrep
🎯 Your 6-Month Objective (Rewritten Clearly)

In 6 months, you want to be able to:

Solve DSA problems from first principles
Explain why a solution works
Optimize from brute force → efficient
Think clearly in system design interviews
Understand AI systems (LLM, RAG, ML systems) at a high level
Have zero fear of “I don’t know where to start”
Have a public, structured GitHub knowledge base
Be interview-ready for FAANG / strong MNCs
Feel intellectually confident, not dependent

This plan is designed only for that.
