# InterviewPrep
🎯 Your 6-Month Objective (Rewritten Clearly)

**In 6 months, you want to be able to:**


Solve DSA problems from first principles.

Explain why a solution works.

Optimize from brute force → efficient.

Think clearly in system design interviews.

Understand AI systems (LLM, RAG, ML systems) at a high level.

Have zero fear of “I don’t know where to start”.

Have a public, structured GitHub knowledge base.

Be interview-ready for FAANG / strong MNCs.

Feel intellectually confident, not dependent.



**This plan is designed only for that.**

## faang-prep-6-months

### Master Roadmap (6 months)
- Month 1: Foundations + Python core
- Month 2: Complexity & core DSA
- Month 3: Advanced DSA (trees, graphs, DP)
- Month 4: System design fundamentals + components
- Month 5: AI foundations and high-level system design for ML
- Month 6: Intensive coding practice, mock interviews, and revision

### Learning philosophy
Focus on correctness first, then complexity. Use spaced repetition and active recall. Practice explaining solutions aloud and in writing.

### Tree dependency explanation
Organized so foundational topics (computers, math, problem-thinking) feed into language specifics and DSA patterns. Follow the tree from foundations → Python → Complexity → Advanced DSA → System design / AI.
