🎯 Why This Roadmap Exists

This roadmap is designed for someone who:

Has industry experience but wants ground-up clarity

Loses motivation when the goal feels too big

Learns best when dependencies are visible

Needs real-world relevance, not abstract grind

Wants small daily wins, not fear-driven pressure

Principle:
You never learn what before understanding why it exists
You never learn how before understanding what it depends on


🧭 How to Use This Roadmap

This document shows the FULL PICTURE (do not read daily)

Daily learning happens from small slices

Everything maps into GitHub notes + code

Every topic answers:

  What problem does this solve?
  
  Why did humans invent this?
  
  What breaks if I don’t know this?

# ⏱️ Daily Execution Rule (Non-Negotiable)

• 10 min → Recall & revise
• 30 min → Learn concept
• 30 min → Implement in Python
• 15 min → Write GitHub notes
• 5 min → Commit & stop
